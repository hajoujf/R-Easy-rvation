# R-Easy-rvation
Been working on this project for my final year at ORT BRAUDE COLLEGE and its called R'Easy'rvation...

This website reimagines the restaurant reservation experience, allowing customers to explore dining options from around the world in an entirely unique way. R'Easy'rvation offers a thrilling twist: like each booking webiste customers can randomly pick tables within the restaurants that they choose but for those with a more discerning palate, an advanced option provides a captivating visualization of each restaurant's layout, enabling customers to handpick their preferred table down to the seat.

R'Easy'rvation offers a dual registration system designed for two distinct user types. Customers can revel in a user-friendly interface, enabling them to place orders, report their restaurant experiences, leave reviews, and easily access their order history.



Meanwhile, restaurant owners have their own portal, allowing them to showcase their culinary treasures. However, inclusion on the platform requires approval from the admin, ensuring that only the finest establishments make the cut. Restaurant owners receive email notifications once their venue is approved, granting them access to a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard empowers them to review performance reports, customize their restaurant's ambiance and layout, curate menus, and engage with customer reviews.

The admin, holding the reins of the entire R'Easy'rvation platform, oversees various critical functions. They manage the financial aspect, taking a modest 20% commission from each order while also curating the platform by approving and, if necessary, removing restaurants to maintain quality standards. 

R'Easy'rvation is different from other websites, it creates an easier environment for food enthusiasts and restaurateurs, saves time and provides a more simple way of handling reservations for restaurantÂ Owners!
